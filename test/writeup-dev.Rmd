## Introduction

A network's robustness primarily concerns how __structural modifications__ (typically vertex deletions) impact the network's __metrics__.

The `netrb` package's purpose is to allow exploration of this relationship while requiring minimal user-end code.

Users can run __simulations__ on a given network, by choosing __focuses__, i.e. metrics / vertex attributes of interest.  For large graphs, there are also programmatic considerations to keep runtimes reasonable.

### Choice of Focuses

*  These will be re-calculated and noted after each set of vertex deletions.  Examples include:
  * Size of the largest remaining component
  * Number of components
  * Mean degree
* Method(s) for 


This relationship's explanatory variable, then, is the magnitude of modifications made, 

Studying this relationship programmatically  which the `netrb` package aims to facilitate with minimal user-end code.

Running such simulations in reasonable amounts of time entails choosing 




 on natural networks or configuration models.  



1. Begin with a graph representation of the network at a given state (typically full / unmodified).
2. Delete a "chunk" of the graph (i.e. one or more vertices) according to some criterion (typically based on vertex attributes, e.g. highest-degree, random).
3. Recalculate and record values of relevant metrics.

In studying this, small graphs often present no challenges in light of runtime; that is, vertices can be deleted one-by-one, and metrics can be re-calculated at each step.

#### Deletions

Runtime considerations may make it best to delete several vertices at on

* __"Chunk" size__, i.e. number of vertices to delete before re-calculating the metrics in question.
* __selection method__, i.e. how to determine which vertices will be  deleted in each chunk.   e.g. highest degree, random.
  * Note: 

#### Metrics

Such requires re-calculating the metrics in question after each "batch" of deletions, which can be done with reasonable runtim

After a certain number of vertices are deleted,
