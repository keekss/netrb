## Introduction

Network robustness primarily concerns the effect of _structural changes_ (typically vertex deletions) on a graph's _metrics_ such as mean distance.  Analyzing this relationship presents a few TODOdesign choices:

#### Deletions
* __"batch size"__, i.e. number of vertices to delete before re-calculating the metrics in question.
* __selection method__, i.e. which vertex attribute will determine the order of deletions, e.g. highest degree, random.
  * Note: 

#### Metrics

Such requires re-calculating the metrics in question after each "batch" of deletions, which can be done with reasonable runtim

After a certain number of vertices are deleted,
